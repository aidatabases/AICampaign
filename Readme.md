# Getting Started

1. Ensure that you have expo-cli installed on your pc.
2. Install the dependencies using 'npm install' command
3. Run 'npm start' and use either your android/ios phone for development testing, for a much better experience use a android or ios emulator on your pc(android studio and xcode).
